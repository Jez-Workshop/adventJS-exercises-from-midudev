## Welcome to the "One Challenge, Three Solutions" series! ðŸš€

In this series, we'll dive into solving programming challenges from AdventJS in three different programming languages: Python, C++, and TypeScript. Each challenge will be solved step by step in all three languages, giving you the opportunity to learn how different programming languages approach the same problem.

### What to expect:

Part 1: Introduction to the series and how weâ€™ll approach the challenges.

Parts 2.x to 4.x Installation guides and environment setup for each language.

Part 5: Automization. Makefile configuration to deal with all terminal command in a nice and elegant way.

Parts 6.x to end In-depth walkthroughs of each challenge, solved in Python, C++, and TypeScript.
